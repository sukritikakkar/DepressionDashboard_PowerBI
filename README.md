# 🧠 Depression Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

---

### 🎯 Objective

This project aims to explore the impact of demographic, academic, lifestyle, and financial factors on student depression levels. The interactive dashboard is built using **Power BI Desktop** and helps visualize how variables like **age**, **sleep duration**, **CGPA**, and **financial stress** relate to depression among students.

---

### 📁 Dataset

The dataset is composed of anonymized responses from students and includes:

- `Age_Group`: Grouped age ranges (e.g., 15–18, 19–22)
- `City`: Location of student
- `Gender`: Male / Female
- `Degree`: Current academic degree
- `Sleep_Duration`: Average daily sleep hours
- `Dietary_Habits`: Type of eating habits
- `Financial_Stress`: Categorical stress level (Low / Moderate / High)
- `CGPA`: Academic performance (binned)
- `Study_Hours`: Daily study time
- `Depression_Status`: Yes / No indicator

---

### 📊 Overview

The Power BI dashboard provides the following:

- A **card** showing % of students reporting depression
- **Depression breakdown** by:
  - Age group and gender
  - Sleep duration
  - Degree program and financial stress levels
  - Dietary habits
- **Academic pressure** visualized using CGPA bins
- Interactive **slicers** for:
  - `Age Group`
  - `City`

All visuals dynamically respond to slicer input for in-depth analysis of different student segments.

- Students with **less sleep** and **irregular dietary habits** showed higher rates of depression.
- **Higher financial stress** was directly associated with increased depression.
- Students in certain **age and CGPA ranges** appeared more vulnerable to academic pressure.
- Depression rates varied across cities and degrees pursued.
